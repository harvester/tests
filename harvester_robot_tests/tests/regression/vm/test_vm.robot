Test VM Basic Lifecycle
    [Tags]    coretest    p0
    [Documentation]    Test basic VM creation, start, stop, delete operations
    When VM is created    ${VM_BASIC}    ${IMAGE_NAME}
    Then VM should be running    ${VM_BASIC}
    And VM should have IP addresses    ${VM_BASIC}    ${DEFAULT_NAMESPACE}
    When VM is stopped    ${VM_BASIC}
    Then VM should be stopped    ${VM_BASIC}
    When VM is started    ${VM_BASIC}
    Then VM should be running    ${VM_BASIC}
    When VM is deleted    ${VM_BASIC}
    Then VM should be deleted    ${VM_BASIC}

Create Stopped VM Stays Stopped
    [Tags]    p0    sanity
    [Documentation]    A VM created with runStrategy=Halted must not boot
    Stopped VM is created    ${VM_STOPPED}    ${IMAGE_NAME}

Start Stopped VM
    [Tags]    p0
    [Documentation]    Starting the stopped VM brings it to running

Hot-Plug Volume Into Running VM
    [Tags]    p0    smoke    volumes
    [Documentation]    Hot-plug an existing volume into a running VM; it must
    ...    appear Ready in the VMI volumeStatus.
    Given VM is created    ${VM_HP}    ${IMAGE_NAME}
    And VM should be running    ${VM_HP}
    And Create Volume    ${DATA_VOL}    1Gi
    And Wait Until Volume Is Active    ${DATA_VOL}
    When Add Volume To VM    ${VM_HP}    ${HP_DISK}    ${DATA_VOL}
