# Introduction

This [Ansible] playbook automatically sets up harvester-installer CI [Jenkins].
Currently it only supports either openSUSE or Ubuntu.

# Setup New Jenkins

To setup [Jenkins] on a target host.

1. Make sure [Ansible] is installed. You can install the latest version
   of [Ansible] using [Python PIP].
2. Copy `settings.yml.sample` to `settings.yml`.
3. Edit `settings.yml` by providing the required configurations. The
   configurations are self-documented.
4. Edit `inventory.harvester-ci` to make sure the host IP and Ansible user are
   correct. **NOTE:** the Ansible user must have SSH access to the CI host and
   have sudo permissions.
5. Run the `install_jenkins.ym` playbook. For example:

```console
ansible-playbook -i inventor.harvester-ci --private-key <ansible user private key> install_jenkins.yml
```
