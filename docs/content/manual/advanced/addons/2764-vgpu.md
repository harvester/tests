# Pre-requisite Enable PCI devices

1. Create a harvester cluster in bare metal mode. Ensure one of the nodes has NIC separate from the management NIC
1. Go to the management interface of the new cluster
1. Go to Advanced -> PCI Devices
1. Validate that the PCI devices aren't enabled
1. Click the link to enable PCI devices
1. Enable PCI devices in the linked addon page
1. Wait for the status to change to `Deploy Successful`
1. Navigate to the PCI devices page
1. Validate that the PCI devices page is populated/populating with PCI devices

# Pre-requisite Enable vGPU

This can only be ran on a bare metal Harvester cluster that has an Nvidia card that support vGPU. You will also need the Nvidia KVM driver and the Nvidia grid installer. These can be downloaded from Nvidia through your partner portal as outlined [here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/vgpu-software-driver/)

1. After the PCI devices are enabled navigate to the `nvidia-driver-toolkit` addon and enable it
1. Wait for the status to change to `Deploy Successful`
1. Edit the config for the `nvidia-driver-toolkit` from the addons page and set the driver location for the KVM driver
1. Navigate to SR-IOV GPU Devices
1. Wait for the GPU to show up in the list
1. Enable the GPU
1. Wait for it to show as enabled and populate with the vGPU devices
1. Navigate to vGPU devices
1. Enable one of the vPGU devices and select a profile
1. Validate that it now shows as enabled

# Test Cases
These tests were ran on Ubuntu focal KVM live images

The setup for the VMs were as follows

```sh
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/wsl-ubuntu/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install cuda nvidia-cuda-toolkit build-essential

git clone https://github.com/nvidia/cuda-samples
cd cuda-samples/Samples/3_CUDA_Features/cudaTensorCoreGemm
make
./cudaTensorCoreGemm
```

## Add one vGPU on VM creation

1. Create a VM and select the vGPU in vGPU devices
1. After the VM is created run the pre-reqs as outlined above
1. Run the grid installer for the vGPU driver on the VM
1. Run the `./cuda-samples/Samples/3_CUDA_Features/cudaTensorCoreGemm`

### Expected Results

1. The VM should create successfully
1. The code should execute successfully

## Add one vGPU after VM creation

1. Create a VM and don't select the vGPU in vGPU devices
1. After the VM is created run the pre-reqs as outlined above
1. Edit the config of the VM and add the vGPU and select to restart
1. Run the grid installer for the vGPU driver on the VM
1. Run the `./cuda-samples/Samples/3_CUDA_Features/cudaTensorCoreGemm`

### Expected Results

1. The VM should create successfully
1. The code should execute successfully

## Remove vGPU from VM

1. Create a VM and select the vGPU in vGPU devices
1. After the VM is created run the pre-reqs as outlined above
1. Run the grid installer for the vGPU driver on the VM
1. Run the `./cuda-samples/Samples/3_CUDA_Features/cudaTensorCoreGemm`
1. Edit the VM config and remove the vGPU and select to restart
1. Run the `./cuda-samples/Samples/3_CUDA_Features/cudaTensorCoreGemm`

### Expected Results

1. The VM should create successfully
1. The code should execute successfully
1. After removal of the vGPU the code should report that there aren't any cuda compatible cards available.

## Disable vGPU device that is in use
This is to be run on a vGPU device that is currently assigned to a VM

1. Disable vGPU device that is in use

### Expected Results

1. You should get an error that says that the vGPU is in use

## Add two vGPUs to VM on creation
There are some limitations to this and they are outlined [here](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.3/advanced/vgpusupport/#attaching-multiple-vgpus)

1. Create a VM and select two vGPUs in vGPU devices
1. Edit the yaml of the VM to add in the following yaml to one of the vGPUs
```yaml
virtualGPUOptions:
  display:
     ramFB:
       enabled: false
```
1. After the VM is created run the pre-reqs as outlined above
1. Run the grid installer for the vGPU driver on the VM
1. Run the `./cuda-samples/Samples/3_CUDA_Features/cudaTensorCoreGemm`

### Expected Results

1. The VM should create successfully
1. The code should execute successfully

## Negative try to provision a VM with an already in use vGPU

The way that vGPUs work is in a pool of resources so the easiest way to test this is if you only have one vGPU device enabled

1. Create a VM and try to select the vGPU in vGPU devices

### Expected Results

1. No vGPU device should show up in the dropdown

## Negative try to enable more vGPUs than the card supports

This is going to vary based on which card you have since the driver itself is loading what's available to the `/sys` tree

1. Attempt to enable a vGPU device after the card is fully provisioned

### Expected Results

1. There should be no profiles available in the dropdown

## Negative try to enable vGPU on card that doesn't support it

This should be ran on a server that has an Nvidia GPU that doesn't support vGPU

1. After the PCI devices are enabled navigate to the `nvidia-driver-toolkit` addon and enable it
1. Wait for the status to change to `Deploy Successful`
1. Edit the config for the `nvidia-driver-toolkit` from the addons page and set the driver location for the KVM driver
1. Navigate to SR-IOV GPU Devices

### Expected Results

1. The GPU should not be listed in SR-IOV GPU Devices
