---


## Category: 
* Upgrade Harvester

## Environment requirement
1. Network environment has available VLAN id setup on DHCP server
1. DHCP server has setup the IP range can allocate to above VLAN id
1. Harvester node can route to DHCP server through VLAN id to retrieve IP address
1. Network has at least two NICs
1. Use HDD disk with SMR type or slow I/O speed
    ```
    n1-103:~ # smartctl -a /dev/sda
    smartctl 7.2 2021-09-14 r5237...
    === START OF INFORMATION SECTION ===
    Model Family:     Seagate BarraCuda 3.5 (SMR)
    ```

## Verification Steps
1. Create images with different OS distribution
1. Create several virtual machines, set network to `management-network` or available `vlan` 
1. Create virtual machine on different target node
1. Setup NFS or S3 backup target in settings
1. Backup each virtual machines
1. Shutdown all virtual machines
1. Offline upgrade to target version, refer to https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1/upgrade/automatic
1. Apply the increase the job deadline workaround before clicking the upgrade button on dashboard
    ```
    $ cat > /tmp/fix.yaml <<EOF
    spec:
    values:
        systemUpgradeJobActiveDeadlineSeconds: "3600"
    EOF

    $ kubectl patch managedcharts.management.cattle.io local-managed-system-upgrade-controller --namespace fleet-local --patch-file=/tmp/fix.yaml --type merge
    $ kubectl -n cattle-system rollout restart deploy/system-upgrade-controller
    ```

1. Setting value exists
1. Check the network connectivity of VLAN
1. Can restore VM from backup 
1. Can import Harvester in Rancher
1. Can add additional nodes to existing Harvester cluster
1. Can create new vms
