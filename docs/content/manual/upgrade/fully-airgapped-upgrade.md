title: Upgrade Harvester in Fully Airgapped Environment
---

## Category: 
* Upgrade Harvester

## Environment requirement
1. Airgapped Network without internet connectivity
1. Network environment has available VLAN id setup on DHCP server
1. DHCP server has setup the IP range can allocate to above VLAN id
1. Harvester node can route to DHCP server through VLAN id to retrieve IP address
1. Network has at least two NICs
1. Suggest not to use SMR type HDD disk

#### We can select VM or Bare machine network setup according to your available resource

## Virtual Machine environment setup
1. Clone ipxe-example https://github.com/harvester/ipxe-examples
1. Switch to v1.0 or main branch
1. Edit Vagrantfile, add a new network interface of `pxe_server.vm.network` 
1. Set the `pxe_server.vm.network` bond to correct `libvirt` network
1. Add two additional new network interface of `harvester_node.vm.network`
1. Edit the settings.yml, set `harvester_network_config.offline: true`
1. Use ipxe-example to provision a multi nodes Harvester cluster
1. Run `varant ssh pxe_server` to access pxe server 
1. Edit the `dhcpd.conf`, let pxe server can create a vlan and assign IP to it 

## Bare machine environment setup
1. Ensure your switch router have setup VLAN network
1. Setup the VLAN connectivity to your Router/Gateway device
1. Disable internet connectivity on Router 
1. Provision a multi nodes Harvester cluster


## Verification Steps
1. For `VLAN 1` testing, enable network on settings, select `harvester-mgmt`
1. Create a `vlan1` network with id `1` on Networks page

1. For other VLAN id testing, enable network on settings, select correct network interface e.g `enps0f1`

1. Create a `vlan91` network with available id `91` on Networks page (id number depends on your available network setting)

1. Create images with different OS distribution
1. Create several virtual machines, set network to `management-network` or available `vlan` 
1. Create virtual machine on different target node
1. Setup NFS or S3 backup target in settings
1. Backup each virtual machines
1. Shutdown all virtual machines
1. Offline upgrade to target version, refer to https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1/upgrade/automatic


## Expected Results
1. Can completely upgrade Harvester to specific version
1. All pods are running correctly
1. Check can display Monitoring Chart 
   - Prometheus dashboard
   - VM metrics
1. Can access dashboard by VIP
1. Can use original password to login
1. Can start VM in running status
1. Image exists without corrupted
1. Volume exists
1. Virtual network exists
1. Backup exists
1. Setting value exists
1. Can restore VM from backup
1. Can create new VMs
