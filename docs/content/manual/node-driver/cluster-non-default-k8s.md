title: Create a harvester cluster with a non-default version of k8s
---
1. Verify versions `1.19.10`, `1.18.18`, `1.17.17`, `1.16.15` respectively

## Expected Results
1. k8s displayed on the UI is consistent with the created version (cluster list, host list)
1. Use `kubectl version` to see that the version information is the same as the created version
