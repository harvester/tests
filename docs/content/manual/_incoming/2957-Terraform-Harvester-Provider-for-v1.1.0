** Harvester Version >= `v1.1.0`**

## Category: 
* Terraform

## Verification Steps


1. Install Harvester with any nodes
1. Install terraform-harvester-provider (using master-head for testing)
1. Execute `terraform init`
1. Create the file network.tf as following snippets:
```
resource "harvester_clusternetwork" "tf_cnet" {
  name = "cnet-003710"
}
resource "harvester_vlanconfig" "tf_vlanconfig" {
  name = "cnet-003710-eno50"

  uplink {
    nics = ["eno50"]
  }

  cluster_network_name = "cnet-003710"
}
resource "harvester_network" "tf_vmnetwork" {
  name = "tf_vmnetwork"

  vlan_id = 1

  cluster_network_name = "cnet-003710"
}
```
1. execute `terraform apply -auto-approve`
1. Login to dashboard then navigate to Networks/Cluster Networks, cluster network `cnet-003710` should be created, vlanconfig `cnet-003710-eno50` should be the member in the cluster network
1. Navigate to Networks/VM Networks, VM Network `tf_vmnetwork` should be created
1. Execute `terraform apply` again and many more times

## Expected Results
1. Cluster Network and Configurations should able to be created
1. VM Network should able to be created
