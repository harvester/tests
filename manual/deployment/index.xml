      <description>Related issues: #1590 Harvester installer can&amp;rsquo;t resolve hostnames Known Issues When supplying multiple ip=&amp;hellip; kernel cmdline arguments, only one of them will be configured by dracut, therefore only the configured interface would have ifcfg generated. So for now, we can&amp;rsquo;t support multiple ip=&amp;hellip; kernel cmdline arguments
Verification Steps Because configuring the network of the installation environment only works with PXE installation, you could use ipxe-examples/vagrant-pxe-harvester/ to set it up. Be sure you can run setup_harvester.</description>
